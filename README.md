*Branch 1.5-Rewrite*

OpenPureTab is an extension for Chrome-based browsers that replaces the default new-tab page with a free and open sourced one, with tons of customization.

###### I started this project because I wanted to add some aesthetics to my new tab page without compromising my privacy or security to shady extensions on the Chrome Web Store.
